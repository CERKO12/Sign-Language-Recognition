In this project, we analyzed and compared the performance of three machine learning algorithms - K-Nearest Neighbors, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Logistic Regression - to recognize and translate sign language into text. 

The dataset format is patterned to match closely with the classic MNIST. Each training and test case represents a label (0-25) as a one-to-one map for each alphabetic letter A-Z (and no cases for 9=J or 25=Z because of gesture motions). The training data (27,455 cases) and test data (7172 cases) are approximately half the size of the standard MNIST but otherwise similar with a header row of label, pixel1,pixel2â€¦.pixel784 which represent a single 28x28 pixel image with grayscale values between 0-255.
